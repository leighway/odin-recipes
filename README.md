Hi! I'm Leigh :)

<p>I'm a mother from the US and am learning how to code through The Odin Project. 
I am currently working on a recipe website to put into action what I've learned through The Odin Project's HTML section of Foundations. </p>
<p>In the Foundations portion of the Odin Project, I am to build a recipe website using only HTML to show that i've learned basic tags and elements such as strong and emphasis as well as how to code ordered and unordered lists.
Some other things that I've learned is making sure I have my boilerpoints at the beginning of my code, and how to insert links, and images. </p>
In this project, I will show you some amazing Asian inspired recipes that I find to be adorable. Thank you for taking the time to look at my first coding creation. Enjoy!
