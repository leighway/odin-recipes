# odin-recipes

<p>In this code, I am testing my knowledge of HTML by building a recipes website with knowledge that I learned in the Foundations portion of The Odin Project. </p>

<p>I have added some elements and tags found in the additional resources portion of the lessons. Lastly, I would like give credit to <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/animerecipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Recipes</a> on Tumblr for the use of their content for my project.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
